# TED Talks

I listen to TED Talks every time I commute while I was working in a company that requires me to travel for 1-2 hours. I realize that I can't read books while inside a moving vehicle so I have to find something: videos, or audios. That's where I found out that a one trip journey allow me to listen to 3-4 TED videos so I start downloading them through my phone (there is an app for that).

This is the list of the best TED Talks that I curated and also found on internet

1. The Key to Success? Grit (Angela Duckworth)
