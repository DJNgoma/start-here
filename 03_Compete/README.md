# 3. Compete

### Now that you have [learned something](  ) and maybe [built some cool things](  ) along the way, what's next then?

Why not trying going for a competition? Incidentally, it's also the best way to find out your current point of learning and seek out teams, rivals and mentors alike. By competing, you gain a sense of how capable the people in your playing field are and establish your standing. For example, questions below can only be answered through competitions:

- *How do I fare against 100 people in this room?*
- *How much do they know that I don't?*
- *Is my algorithm the best solution out there?*

It's also a place where you can test that burning idea you've had in mind for a while. In the programming/computing scene, there are few kinds of competitions that's available but they're mostly grouped up to these categories:

1. Mastery of a specific skill/concept (mostly for individuals)
	- Competitive Programming
2. How you can take advantage of an existing technology (mostly in teams)
	- Hackathons
	- Hack Day
	- StartupWeekend
	- Google's Summer of Code

## Hackathons

*“A hackathon, a hacker neologism, is an event when programmers meet to do collaborative computer programming.” - [WTF is a hackathon?](https://medium.com/hackathons-anonymous/wtf-is-a-hackathon-92668579601#.tgzs6u12g)*

To put it simply, a hackathon is an event where you gather a bunch of people who have a common interest in programming to build solutions based on a provided challenges/themes. It's really similar to case competitions typically arranged by L'Oreal/P&G but it's more tech-oriented and you're normally required to build a prototype out of it in a limited duration (12/24 hours or even more).

Most hackathons are one-time event although some are organized annually in partnership with a certain organizations/companies. List of popular hackathons that have happened in Malaysia/Singapore involving big names includes:

- [MasterCard Masters of Code](http://mastersofcode.com)
- [Emirates Travel Hackathon](http://www.emirateshackathon.com/)
- [PayPal BattleHack](https://2015.battlehack.org/)
- [AngelHack Global Series](http://angelh.wpengine.com/previous-hackathons/)
- [UN Women: United We Hack](http://unitedwehack.com/)
- [Budweiser's Dream Brewery Hackathon](http://singapore.impacthub.net/dream-brewery-hackathon)

Most of hackathon projects are submitted to a platform where it can be evaluated by panel of judges, this include [Hackathon.io](http://hackathon.io) (mostly for AngelHack related events) or [Devpost](http://devpost.com/). You can check an example of a judged project [here](http://www.hackathon.io/moneyremaid).
