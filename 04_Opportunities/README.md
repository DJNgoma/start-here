#4. Opportunities

### Time to make that dream happen

## LinkedIn

### Why is it important?

It's your professional profile and a hiring platform at the same time. You can certainly count it as another social media network, but it has a professional tone with more often than not, accompanied by professional pictures and resume and positions worked before.

## Review

It's really important to check for reviews on places that you've worked before. [Glassdoor](https://glassdoor.com) is a nice place for this, but most of the times your school will already have a network containing all these information. Contact your department or alumni.

## Part time/Freelancing

The general rule of thumb is to take projects only from people you know personally. And despite its name, freelancing is a full-time job with limited contract (or sometime no contract, when this happen, please do make a written contract with your client/your project takers to protect both parties). You should always charge by milestones.

## Internships

Internship is typically defined as onsite job training. For top companies like Google, Apple or Facebook, you usually have to watch out for their internship applications for more than 6 months (e.g. Google Software Engineering Internship application for Winter 2016 opens in Winter 2015). Most internships are either in Summer/Winter.

## Full time

### Important: Make sure to obtain all the necessary work visa and documents before working in your destination country
