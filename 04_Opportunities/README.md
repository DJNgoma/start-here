#4. Opportunities

### Time to make that dream happen

## LinkedIn

### Why is it important?

It's your professional profile and a hiring platform at the same time. You can certainly count it as another social media network, but it has a professional tone with more often than not, accompanied by professional pictures and resume and positions worked before.

## Review

It's really important to check for reviews on places that you've worked before. Glassdoor is a nice place for this, but most of the times your school will already have a network containing all these information. Contact your department or alumni.

## Part time/Freelancing

It's actually recommended to take projects only from people you know, and take note that a freelance project is a full-time project, it's just that you're taking with limited contract (or sometime no contract, when this happen, please do make a written contract with your client/your project takers).

## Internships

Try watching out for internships months before they open because for popular positions with top companies, applications open months before the batch started (e.g. Google Software Engineering Internship application for Winter 2016 opens in Winter 2015, meaning that you have to watch it out a year before). Most internships are either in Summer/Winter.
